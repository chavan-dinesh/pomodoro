Pomodoro Timer App to boost your productivity

The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

After 1st 2nd 3rd 25 minutes work , there will be 5 minutes break and after 4th 25 minute work there will be longer break of 20 minutes.
